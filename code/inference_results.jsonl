{"question": "Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?", "solution": "Half of 4 hours is 2 hours. So the time spent recording is 2 hours. Add the editing time of 90 minutes and the total time for the entire project is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. That means she spent (90 / 7.5) * 100 = 12% of the total time editing.

What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?\nA: Half of 4 hours is 2 hours. So the time spent recording is 2 hours. Add the editing time of 90 minutes and the total time for the entire project is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. That means she spent (90 / 7.5) * 100 = 12% of the total time editing. The answer is 12%.\n\nVerification: Is the answer correct? No\nA: The total time spent editing is 90 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. The total time spent on the project is 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours. To calculate the percentage of time spent editing, we can use the equation: (time spent editing / total time spent) * 100%. Plugging in the values, we get: (1.5 / 7.5) * 100% = 20%. The answer is 20%.\n\nVerification: Is the answer correct? No\n", "You are a math teacher.\n Verify the question and answer.
