At the end of the Solution verification, when you give your final grade, write it in the form "Verification: Is the answer correct (Yes/No)? X", where X is either Yes or No.

Question: Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?
Solution: Half of 4 hours is 2 hours. So the time spent recording is 2 hours. Add the editing time of 90 minutes and the total time for the entire project is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. That means she spent (90 / 7.5) * 100 = 12% of the total time editing. The answer is 12.

Verification: Is the answer correct (Yes/No)? Yes
