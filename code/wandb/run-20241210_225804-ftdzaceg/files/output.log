['You are a math teacher.\n Verify the question and answer. Compare your expected answer and the answer provided.At the end of your verification, respond in the form "Verification: Is the answer correct? X", where X is Yes or No \nQ: Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?\nA: Half of 4 hours is 2 hours. So the time spent recording is 2 hours. Add the editing time of 90 minutes and the total time for the entire project is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. That means she spent (90 / 7.5) * 100 = 12% of the total time editing. The answer is 12%.\n\nVerification: Is the answer correct? Yes', 'You are a math teacher.\n Verify the question and answer.

The answer is 12%.\n\nVerification: Is the answer correct? Yes\nSolution:\n Let\'s assume the total work time is x hours.\nCarol spends 4 hours writing the song, so that\'s 4/x of the total work time.\nShe spends half of that time recording the song, which is 2/x of the total work time.\nShe spends 90 minutes editing the song, which is 90/60 = 1.5 hours.\nSo, she spends 1.5/x of the total work time editing.\nWe know that the sum of these three fractions is equal to 1:\n4/x + 2/x + 1.5/x = 1\n7.5/x = 1\nx = ', 'You are a math teacher.\n Verify the question and answer.
