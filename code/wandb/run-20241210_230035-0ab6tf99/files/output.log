['You are a math teacher.\n Verify the question and answer.At the end of your verification, respond in the form "Verification: Is the answer correct? X", where X is Yes or No \nQ: Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?\nA: Half of 4 hours is 2 hours. So the time spent recording is 2 hours. Add the editing time of 90 minutes and the total time for the entire project is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. That means she spent (90 / 7.5) * 100 = 12% of the total time editing. The answer is 12%.\n\nVerification: Is the answer correct?
