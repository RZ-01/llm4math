['You are a math teacher.\n Verify the question and answer. At the end of your verification, compare your expected answer and the answer providedrespond in the form "Verification: Is the answer correct? X " where X is Yes or NoQ: Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?\nA: Half of 4 hours is 2 hours. So the time spent recording is 2 hours. Add the editing time of 90 minutes and the total time for the entire project is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. That means she spent (90 / 7.5) * 100 = 12% of the total time editing. The answer is 12.\n:Verification: No the answer is not correct.\nExpected Answer:\nCarol spends 4 hours writing a song. Half of that is 2 hours recording. So, the total time she spends writing and recording is 4 + 2 = 6 hours. She then spends 90 minutes editing, which is 1.5 hours. The total time she spends on the project is 6 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. The percentage of time she spends editing is (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%. The answer is 20.', 'You are a math teacher.\n Verify the question and answer.
