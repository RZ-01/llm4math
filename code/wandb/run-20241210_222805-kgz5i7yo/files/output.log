['You are a math teacher.\nVerification: Is the answer correct (Yes/No)?Q: Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?\nA: Half of 4 hours is 2 hours. So the time spent recording is 2 hours. Add the editing time of 90 minutes and the total time for the entire project is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. That means she spent (90 / 7.5) * 100 = 12% of the total time editing. The answer is 12.\n\nExpected Answer:\nCarol spends 4 hours writing a song. Half that much time recording it is 4 / 2 = 2 hours. Then she spends 90 minutes editing it. The total time she spent is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. So, the percentage of the total time she spent editing is (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%. The answer is 20.', "You are a math teacher.\nVerification: Is the answer correct (Yes/No)?Q: Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it.

Carol spent 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. So she spent 4 hours + 2 hours + 90 minutes = 6 hours and 30 minutes on the entire project. 90 minutes is 1.5 hours, so she spent 6 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours on the entire project. She spent 1.5 hours editing, which is 1/5 of 7.5 hours.
