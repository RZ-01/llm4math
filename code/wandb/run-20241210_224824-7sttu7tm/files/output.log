X", where X is Yes or No \nQ: Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?\nA: Half of 4 hours is 2 hours. So the time spent recording is 2 hours. Add the editing time of 90 minutes and the total time for the entire project is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. That means she spent (90 / 7.5) * 100 = 12% of the total time editing.

The correct solution should be: \nCarol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. \nTo find the percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we can use the following formula: \nPercentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time for the entire project) * 100 \nTime spent editing = 90 minutes = 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours \nTotal time for the entire project = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours ', 'You are a math teacher.\n Verify the question and answer.
